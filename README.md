## üîß Packet Tracer Lab Activities

Each lab simulates a real-world networking scenario and helps reinforce theory through practice.

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Network simulation and configuration
- **Wireshark** *(limited use)*: Packet analysis and inspection
- **Windows CMD**: Network diagnostics and tools
  - `ipconfig`
  - `ping`
  - `tracert`
  - `netstat`

---

## üöÄ What's Next?

- Begin Security+ preparation
- Continue with hands-on labs via TryHackMe or HackTheBox (network focus)
- Explore real-world tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and VPN configurations
- Apply for hands-on opportunities such as apprenticeships or junior roles

## üß† Reflections

Learning networking from the ground up has shown me the "why" behind how the internet works. Every broadcast frame, every TTL decrement ‚Äî it all has purpose. I‚Äôve developed a passion for understanding data at its most fundamental level, and this course has set the stage for my future in **cyber security**.
